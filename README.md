# Mad Libs

This is a program for playing the classic word game, Mad Libs.

## Motivation

I wanted to virtualize a simple and fun game.

## How To Use

To begin, run my_script.py. You will be given a few options for story templates to choose from. You then can enter either the title of the story template (not case sensitive) or the number in parentheses after the title. The program will prompt you for various types of words (verb, noun, adjective, etc.), and these words will be used to fill in the story template. The final story, complete with the user input words, will be printed. You can then either choose another story to complete, or quit the game.
